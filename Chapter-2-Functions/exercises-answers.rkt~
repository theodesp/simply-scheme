;3.1  Translate the arithmetic expressions (3+4)×5 and 3+(4×5) into Scheme expressions, and into plumbing diagrams.

(* (+ 3 4) 5)
(+ (* 4 5) 3)

;3.2  How many little people does Alonzo hire in evaluating each of the following expressions:
;
;(+ 3 (* 4 5) (- 10 4))

; Answer: 29

;(+ (* (- (/ 8 2) 1) 5) 2)
;
; Answer: 17


;(* (+ (- 3 (/ 4 2))
;      (sin (* 3 2))
;      (- 8 (sqrt 5)))
;   (- (/ 2 3)
;      4))

;3.3  Each of the expressions in the previous exercise is compound. How many subexpressions (not including subexpressions of subexpressions) does each one have?
;
;For example,
;
;(* (- 1 (+ 3 4)) 8)
;has three subexpressions; you wouldn't count (+ 3 4).
;
;3.4  Five little people are hired in evaluating the following expression:
;
;(+ (* 3 (- 4 7))
;   (- 8 (- 3 5)))
;Give each little person a name and list her specialty, the argument values she receives, her return value, and the name of the little person to whom she tells her result.
;3.5  Evaluate each of the following expressions using the result replacement technique:
;
;(sqrt (+ 6 (* 5 2)))
;
;(+ (+ (+ 1 2) 3) 4)
;3.6  Draw a plumbing diagram for each of the following expressions:
;
;(+ 3 4 5 6 7)
; 
;(+ (+ 3 4) (+ 5 6 7))
; 
;(+ (+ 3 (+ 4 5) 6) 7)
;3.7  What value is returned by (/ 1 3) in your version of Scheme? (Some Schemes return a decimal fraction like 0.33333, while others have exact fractional values like 1/3 built in.)
;
(/ 1 3)

;3.8  Which of the functions that you explored in Chapter 2 will accept variable numbers of arguments?

;Real Exercises
;3.9  The expression (+ 8 2) has the value 10. It is a compound expression made up of three atoms. For this problem, write five other Scheme expressions whose values are also the number ten:
;
;•	    	An atom
10
;•	    	Another compound expression made up of three atoms
(- 12 2)
;•	    	A compound expression made up of four atoms
(- (+ 6 6) 2) 
;•	    	A compound expression made up of an atom and two compound subexpressions
;•	    	Any other kind of expression
